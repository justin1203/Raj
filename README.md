  The system is a computer tech support agent. The user provides the agent with her symptoms
  and the agent provides the user with the solution to the problem and generates step-by-step
  instructions.
  
A+ Features:
  Trouble shoot 15 problems.
  Clear Documentation of all 15 problems and how they relate, how to generate step-by-step instructions, and how to identify the problems.
	Text mine for swear words.

Files:
	Project/src/bot.java: Main java file
	Project/src/Swear.java: Class for swear words

Known Issues:
	When the user inputs “no sound” as her symptom, the system thinks the user has typed
  “no” and never diagnoses the problem. It works if the user doesn’t use the word “no”
  (i.e. “there isn’t any sound”).
